# debiansuiteforme

standardising the rest of my installation after netinstall iso for debian, might switch to devuan, for maximum productivity, tired of doing configuring it a 1000x

nano into the script after cloning it to change the software selection
my goal is to include a suite of software and configuration to optimise workflow
a configured, flexible tiling manager is a must
i dont expect anyone to come across this, but in cas you do, this isnt my jam... 
im trying to make something work for me so that i dont have to configure a pc much ever again... 
it will be a journey of destruction and regeneration... 
im learning... 
dont trust this code with your life... 
it's mostly for myself...
thank you

im a noob

im starting on github.....
